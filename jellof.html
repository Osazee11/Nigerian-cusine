    <ul>
        <li> 2 cups of long-grain parboiled rice </li>
           <li>2-3 medium-sized ripe tomatoes </li>
           <li> 1-2 red bell peppers (tatashe)</li>
          <li>1-2 Scotch bonnet peppers (atarodo) - adjust to taste for spiciness</li>
            <li>1 medium-sized onion</li>
            <li>3-4 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of thyme</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of curry powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of dried thyme</li>
            <li>1-2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>1-2 teaspoons of paprika</li>
            <li>1-2 cups of chicken or vegetable broth</li>
            <li> 1/4 - 1/2 cup of vegetable oil or palm oil</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>

           <p> Instructions:</p>
            
            Rinse the rice in cold water until the water runs clear. Drain and set aside.
            Blend the tomatoes, red bell peppers, Scotch bonnet peppers, onion, and garlic until smooth to make a puree.
            Heat the vegetable oil or palm oil in a large pot or skillet over medium heat.
            Add the blended puree to the hot oil and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture thickens and the excess water evaporates, about 10-15 minutes.
            Add the thyme, curry powder, dried thyme, paprika, bay leaves, and salt to taste. Stir well to combine.
            Add the chicken or vegetable broth to the pot and bring to a boil.
            Once the mixture is boiling, add the rinsed rice and stir to combine, ensuring the rice is evenly coated with the sauce.
            Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let the rice simmer for about 20-25 minutes, or until the rice is cooked through and fluffy. If using, add the optional vegetables and protein halfway through the cooking time.
            Once the rice is cooked, fluff it with a fork and remove the bay leaves.
            Serve the Nigerian Jollof rice hot, garnished with additional sliced tomatoes, onions, or fresh herbs if desired. Enjoy</li>
